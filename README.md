# Mars_Challenge
In this Jupyter notebook, I conducted a two-part exploration of Martian data. In the first part, I automated web browsing to scrape news articles from the Mars News site. I identified key HTML elements using BeautifulSoup, extracted relevant information, and stored it in a structured format.

In the second part, I extended your web scraping skills to gather temperature data from the Mars Temperature Data site. Leveraging Pandas and Beautiful Soup, I organized the data into a DataFrame, ensuring appropriate data types for analysis. I then answered questions about the Martian climate, visualized temperature patterns, and estimated the length of a Martian year.

My code showcased a blend of web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization techniques in the context of Martian weather exploration. The use of Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Matplotlib demonstrated a robust approach to extracting insights from web data. The final step involved exporting the processed data to a CSV file for potential future use or sharing.
